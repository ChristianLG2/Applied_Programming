Overview
The "Hello World" project is a classic exercise that demonstrates the fundamentals of programming and system interaction in C#. It serves as a foundation for more complex projects, allowing me to explore the nuances of the C# language and .NET framework.

This simple console application outputs the phrase "Hello World" to the console. Creating this software served as an exercise to practice basic C# syntax and understand the workflow of a C# application, including compiling and executing the code.

Here is a two-minute video demonstration of the software running along with a walkthrough of the code:
